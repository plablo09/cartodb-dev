This is a http://www.vagrantup.com/[vagrant] configuration to setup a development environment for https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb[CartoDB]. 

== Structure 

Base OS for this configuration in Vagrant terms is "precise32", which is an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS distro. A bunch of shell scripts does the provisioning. The installation procedure is split to many scripts in-order to isolate failure and facilitate reruns footnote:[Need to comment out previous steps in Vagrant file for now].

== Usage

----
git clone git@github.com:nighthacker/cartodb-dev.git
cd cartodb-dev
vagrant up
----

As CartoDB is pretty heavy, the script takes quite some time to download the required dependencies. Once the provisioning is done, all you are required to do is start CartoDB.

----
vagrant ssh
cd /usr/local/src/cartodb
sudo bundle exec foreman start -p 3000
----

As the domain property in the configuration is set to localhost.lan, the host machine is required to have a name to address mapping. Following line does the trick,

----
echo "127.0.0.1 monkey.localhost.lan" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
----

The vagrant configuration forwards port 3000 from the host to the guest. So monkey.localhost.lan:3000 from the host machine will take you to the CartoDB's login page. The password is same as the username.

Have fun!
